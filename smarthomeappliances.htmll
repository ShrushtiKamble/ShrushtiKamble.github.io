  <h1>  <span style="color:blue">SMART HOME APPLIANCES</span> </h1>
  <h2> INTRODUCTION </h2>
<p> The advancement of home automation technology has enabled users to control and monitor household appliances remotely and intelligently. This project presents a cost-effective and efficient smart home control system using discrete electronic components such as relays, transistors, optocouplers, and microcontrollers. The primary goal is to operate and automate up to four home appliances using a 5V relay module setup.

The system is designed around four 5V SPDT relays, each capable of switching a separate appliance. To ensure safe and isolated switching, PC817 optocouplers are used, providing electrical isolation between the control logic and high-voltage appliance circuits. BC547 transistors act as switches to drive the relays based on control signals, while 1N4007 diodes protect the transistors from voltage spikes caused by relay coil back EMF. Proper current limiting and biasing are achieved using 510-ohm and 1k-ohm resistors.

Each channel includes an LED indicator for visual feedback, and push buttons offer manual override or control. The entire circuit is powered by a 5V DC supply and connected using terminal blocks for reliable and organized wiring.

This setup serves as a fundamental building block for more advanced smart home systems and can be further integrated with microcontrollers (like NodeMCU or Arduino) to enable wireless control through voice assistants or mobile apps. </p>
